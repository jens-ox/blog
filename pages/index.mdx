# Hi!

I'm Jens Ochsenmeier. I lead the Fullstack Engineering team at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/), developing applications that

- help people understand complex systems, and
- turn machine learning models into actionable insights and decisions.

I've previously worked at [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/), [ArtiMinds Robotics](https://www.artiminds.com/) and [Mercedes-Benz](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/de/).

See [Projects](/projects) for my open-source projects.

See [Blog](/blog) for my posts.
