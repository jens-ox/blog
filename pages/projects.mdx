## MetricsGraphics

MetricsGraphics is a data visualization library originally developed at Mozilla. I took over maintainership in 2020 and rewrote it in modern TypeScript.

## sane-code

When developing fullstack applications, there are tons of gotchas that one learns to see over the years. Some of them are very obvious (put your development dependencies in `devDependencies`), some are not (unnecessary default values in `tsconfig.json`). This tool is an effort to automate the detection of as many of those gotchas as possible.

## bund.dev

There are tons of government databases out there containing public information, but they either have no machine-readable interface at all or only undocumented ones. [bund.dev](https://bund.dev/) is a community effort to document those APIs using OpenAPI specs.

The project was initiated by [Lilith Wittmann](https://links.lilithwittmann.de/).
