I currently work as a fullstack developer at [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/). Previously, I

- worked in Data Engineering for Robotics at [ArtiMinds Robotics](https://www.artiminds.com/),
- worked in Data Mining for Production Control at [Daimler AG](https://daimler.com/),
- studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/).

## Interests

My main interests are

- **High Quality Code**: I enjoy writing highly maintainable and well-documented code -- or transforming legacy code-bases to such a state (see e.g. the re-write of [MetricsGraphics](https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics)).
- **One-off data visualizations to communicate information**: I maintain different data visualization libraries and try to provide tools to create data visualizations that are interactive and well-suited for the modern web.
- **Production Optimization** using real-time handling and analysis of large amounts of data.

In my free time I enjoy running and cycling - find me on Strava!
