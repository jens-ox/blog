I currently work as a Software Engineer at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com), focusing on fullstack web development. Previously, I

- worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Blue Yonder](https://blueyonder.com/),
- worked in Data Engineering for industrial robotics at [ArtiMinds Robotics](https://www.artiminds.com/),
- worked in Data Mining for production control at [Daimler AG](https://www.daimler.com/),
- studied computer science with a focus on mathematics at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/).

## Interests

My main interests are

- **High Quality Code**: I enjoy writing highly maintainable and well-documented code ‚Äî or transforming legacy code-bases to such a state (see e.g. the re-write of [MetricsGraphics](https://github.com/metricsgraphics/metrics-graphics)).

- **Interpretability of complex systems**: Using web technologies to make complex systems easier to understand has been the common denominator in most of my work; for globally-distributed production scenarios at Daimler, for robotic motion optimization at ArtiMinds and for machine learning-based demand forecasting at Blue Yonder.

- **Running** üèÉ
